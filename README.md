Aim of this project: familiarize myself with frontend work such as creating a front page and customizing it and look into REST api by create, delete and fetching info from my postgres database.

This is a basic website that aims to advertise a specific kind of product namely Rectangles. On my website you can create your own rectangles by customizing them, naming them and giving them a customized messages.

After that, your rectangle will be uploaded to our database where you can choose to delete to view it again.
